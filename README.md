Arduino based quick test programs to validate sensors, actuators and microcontrollers

This has a number of Arduino (or other microcontroller) based programs that I use whenever I get a new sensor, actuator or microcontroller and I want to quickly test it to validate it is in good condition and works as expected (e.g. as per it's datasheet). Some of these are not mine and I have taken the liberty of putting them here. In all such cases, I've retained the original author's name and comments for attribution.
